# **Efficient Log Retrieval from a Large File (1TB)**  

## **✅ Problem Overview**  
The task was to efficiently extract logs from a **large log file (~1TB)** containing logs from multiple years.  
Each log entry starts with a **timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)**, followed by a log level and a message.  
Since logs are evenly distributed across days, an **efficient approach** was needed to avoid excessive memory usage.

## **✅ Solutions Considered**  

### **1️⃣ Line-by-Line Streaming (Final Choice)**
✔ Reads **one line at a time** (O(1) space complexity).  
✔ Uses **`substr(0,10)`** for fast date filtering.  
✔ Works efficiently on **large files (~1TB)**.  
✔ **Final choice due to efficiency, simplicity, and cross-platform support**.  

### **2️⃣ Index-Based Search (Not Used)**
❌ Requires **pre-indexing in a database** (not feasible for one-time queries).  
❌ Adds **storage overhead**.  

### **3️⃣ Using `grep` (Fastest for Linux/Mac)**
✔ Very **fast** for **Unix-based systems**.  
❌ **Not portable for Windows users**.

## **✅ Why I Chose the Line-by-Line Approach?**
- ✅ **Efficient:** Reads only **one line at a time** (no large memory usage).  
- ✅ **Cross-Platform:** Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.  
- ✅ **Scalable:** Handles **very large files (~1TB)** smoothly.  
- ✅ **Simple to Implement:** No need for **complex indexing or additional dependencies**.  

---

## **✅ Final Solution Summary**  
- The program **reads `logs_2024.log` line-by-line**, **extracts logs for a given date**, and **saves results** in `output/output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`.  
- This approach **minimizes memory usage** while ensuring **fast execution**.  
- **Scalable, simple, and works well for large log files (~1TB).**

Steps to Run the Solution
1️⃣ Compile the C++ Program
bash
g++ -o extract_logs src/extract_logs.cpp
2️⃣ Run the Program
bash
./extract_logs 2024-12-01
3️⃣ Check the Extracted Logs
bash
cat output/output_2024-12-01.txt
4️⃣ (Windows) Open the Output in Notepad
powershell
notepad output/output_2024-12-01.txt

✅ Edge Cases Handled
✔ Handles Empty Log Files – If no logs exist for the given date, a warning is displayed.
✔ Handles Large Files (1TB) – Uses O(1) space by processing one line at a time.
✔ Handles Missing Files – Displays an error if logs_2024.log does not exist.
✔ Handles Incorrect Date Formats – Prevents invalid searches.

✅ Possible Future Optimizations
1️⃣ Multi-threaded Processing – If the file is stored on an SSD, parallel processing could make extraction faster.
2️⃣ Indexed Search for Frequent Queries – If log searches are frequent, an indexing approach (SQLite, Elasticsearch) could improve performance.
3️⃣ Pre-sorted Log Storage – If logs were stored in separate files per day (YYYY-MM-DD.log), retrieval would be instant.

✅ Conclusion
This solution is a fast, scalable, and efficient way to extract logs for a given date from a huge log file (~1TB).
It ensures minimal resource usage and is easy to use on any platform. 🚀
